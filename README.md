# STPM Starter Package

This is a test package for STPM-native imports. It includes sections, snippets, assets, locales, and settings.

## Authoring

1. Use folder structures at the root level that match the native Shopify theme structure ('sections', 'snippets', 'templates', 'locales', 'config', etc.).
2. Ensure the stpm.type field is included in your package.json file:

```
"stpm": {
  "type": "native"
}
```
